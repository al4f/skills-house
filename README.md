**Author, build, and ship agentic software with [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) — from one framework.**

skills-house is an open-source **framework** for building skill-based agent apps — built by [al4f](https://al4f.dev). Scaffold a project, define skills, compile to spec-compliant output, and ship to Cursor, Claude, Codex, mobile agents, and more.

**Framework docs:** **[al4f.dev](https://al4f.dev)** · [Architecture specs](./specs/) · [Agent Skills at Scale](https://al4f.dev/writing/agent-skills-at-scale.html)

**Built by [al4f](https://github.com/al4f)** — Agent Skills infrastructure engineer.

**Install a skill in any repo** ([skills.sh CLI](https://www.skills.sh/docs/cli)):

```bash
npx skills add al4f/skills-house --skill skill-auditor -a cursor -y
```

---

## Why skills-house?

Agent Skills are powerful, but authoring them at scale gets messy fast:

- Duplicated scripts across skills
- Large `SKILL.md` files that burn context
- Manual copying into `~/.cursor/skills`, `.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`, …
- No shared build step between source and what agents actually load

skills-house fixes that with a clear split — for developers and non-developers building agentic apps with Cursor, Claude, mobile agents, and more:

| Layer | What it is |
|-------|------------|
| **Source** (`skills/`) | Freeform authoring — only `SKILL.md` is required |
| **Scripts** (`scripts/`) | Reusable execution packages shared across skills |
| **Build** (`@skills-house/build`) | Compiles markers + links → Agent Skills layout |
| **Dist** (`skills-dist/`) | What agents consume |
| **Install** | `npx skills add owner/repo --skill <name>` (consumer) · `pnpm install:skills` (monorepo dev only) |

---

## Features

- **Simple authoring** — `@include` for markdown fragments; standard `[label](target)` links for everything else
- **Shared script packages** — reference `fixture-helper/hello` instead of copy-pasting shell scripts
- **Agent Skills compliant output** — `SKILL.md`, `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`
- **Multi-agent install** — global (`~/.cursor/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`, …) or project-local (`.agents/skills`, `.claude/skills`, …)
- **pnpm monorepo** — skills, scripts, and tooling in one workspace

---

## Quick start

```bash
npx create-skills-house my-app
cd my-app
pnpm dev          # build + install skills to this project
```

Until `create-skills-house` is published to npm, scaffold from a clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/al4f/skills-house.git
cd skills-house && nvm use && pnpm install && pnpm build
node internal-scripts/create/dist/cli.js my-app
```

**Contributors** — work from this reference monorepo:

**Requirements:** Node.js LTS (see `.nvmrc`), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/al4f/skills-house.git
cd skills-house
nvm use
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

Install built skills into your agent (optional):

```bash
pnpm install:skills --scope project
```

Install globally for all agents:

```bash
pnpm install:skills
```

Uninstall:

```bash
pnpm remove:skills --scope project
pnpm remove:skills --scope project
pnpm remove:skills --agent cursor --skill skill-auditor
```

---

## Example skill

One reference skill ships with the framework to demonstrate patterns — not a catalog. Fork the framework and add skills in **your** repo; consumers install with `npx skills add your-org/your-repo --skill <name>`.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [skill-auditor](./skills/skill-auditor/) | Validates Agent Skills before ship — shows `@include`, references, and shared scripts |

Updates to the example skill auto-merge when validation passes. New skills in this repo require maintainer review. See [Contributing](#contributing).

---

## Authoring a skill

Source layout is **freeform**. The build only requires `SKILL.md` as entry.

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What it does and when to use it.
---

# My Skill

@include /sections/workflow.md

Read [the guide](/references/deep-dive.md) when needed.
Run [hello](fixture-helper/hello).
```

### Reference rules

| Link target | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| `/references/foo.md` | In-package file → copied to dist |
| `package/export` | Named export from a `scripts/` package |
| `other-skill` | Skill dependency (install note injected at build) |

Only **`@include /path`** is a build marker. Everything else uses markdown links.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm build` | Build compiler + all skills |
| `pnpm test` | Run build pipeline tests |
| `pnpm validate` | Run per-package validate scripts + registry typecheck |
| `pnpm generate` | Generate registry index, search index, dependency graph, website data |
| `pnpm generate:check` | Regenerate and fail if output is stale |
| `pnpm install:skills` | Install built dist skills to agent directories (monorepo dev) |
| `npx skills add al4f/skills-house --skill <name>` | Install from GitHub via [skills.sh](https://www.skills.sh/docs/cli) ([guide](./content/publish/INSTALL.md)) |
| `npx create-skills-house <dir>` | Scaffold a new skills-house project |
| `pnpm remove:skills` | Remove installed skills (monorepo script) |

Build a single skill:

```bash
pnpm --filter @skills-house/skill-auditor build
```

### Install flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--agent cursor\|claude\|codex\|agents` | Target one agent |
| `--scope global\|project` | User home vs repo-local paths |
| `--skill <name>` | Install/remove one skill only |
| `--copy` | Copy files instead of symlinking (install only) |
| `--dry-run` | Preview actions |

### Install paths

**Global** (`pnpm install:skills`):

| Agent | Directory |
|-------|-----------|
| agents (open standard) | `~/.agents/skills/` |
| codex | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| cursor | `~/.cursor/skills/` |
| claude | `~/.claude/skills/` |

**Project** (`pnpm install:skills --scope project`):

| Agent | Directory |
|-------|-----------|
| agents / codex | `.agents/skills/` |
| cursor | `.agents/skills/` + `.cursor/skills/` |
| claude | `.claude/skills/` |

Project install paths are gitignored — they are local symlinks/copies from `skills-dist/`.
